# UnoForDashain
Dashain is a big festival, which is celebrated in Nepal. People do various activities during this festival, and playing cards is one of my best among those. Instead of playing the usual 52 cards, I decided to go with UNO, which is not usually played in Nepal, this Dashain. Why we play cards? Duh, for money, right? Since UNO does not involve wagering money, I and my other folks from the family made our own rules- Winner gets Rs.50 from all the losers. We settled for the first round, but everyone was loaded with the big cash- Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000. The game went well until my cousin started keeping an account for every player in the spreadsheet. Sometimes we ended up paying more money than the individual, actually, had to pay :v 
As I had a basic Python knowledge, I planned to write a bunch of ``` if-else ``` statements to kill some leisure time, and to ease the "accounting" of the game. I ended up coding 300+ lines. Go through it! And leave a feedback @kushal.sarkar on Instagram. LOL!
