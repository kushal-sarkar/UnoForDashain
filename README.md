# UnoForDashain
Dashain, also known as Bijaya Dashami, is the grandest, longest and most auspicious festival in Nepal. During this festival, people do various activities, which make the festival more fun. Playing cards is one of the best parts of Dashain. Gambling within the family has always been fun. UnoForDashain is a few lines of Python codes that help players to monitize and keep accounts of every round of UNO game, which is genrerally played without money, but for Dashain. P.S : I do not promote gamblings in any mean.
